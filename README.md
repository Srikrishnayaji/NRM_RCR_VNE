Virtual Network Embedding based on Computing, Network and Storage Resource Constraints
 
Our project is an implementation of the VNE research paper using VNEP/alib simulation tool.
The code is written in python2 and the required python libraries are gurobipy, numpy, cPickle, networkx 1.9, matplotlib, pip2. 

To start with the setup execute the following command in the alib directory.
``pip install .``

To run the code execute the run.py file.

``python2 run.py``

The command line input is to be given. The substrate network parameters are to be given followed by the virtual network data.
